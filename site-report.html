                    <h2>Experience of Learning Web Development</h2>
                    <p>In my life this is the first time when I used to write and run the code.
                        In terms of my experience I could say that it’s not that too easy and
                        it’s not that far hard to learn the html and CSS.In my school time,
                        I learn about some basic of html like header, body, main, underline, navigation etc… but,
                        how it actually work and how an HTML and CSS work together and
                        makes something extraordinary to any of the websites that I learned from this module Web Development.
                        According to me, Html gives the format or date of the page while the CSS gives out the style to that particular page.
                        Still, I couldn’t say that I have gain the full knowledge of the styling in CSS
                        I felt up many times the problem while arranging the images on the proper side, making bigger fonts, arranging
                        plenty of varieties on the pages. However, while keeping practising I think it will be work out.</p>

                <div class="ui">

                    <p>In my all pages i used different fonts,color and different sizes for the texts like bold and thick for heading, for the different texts designs and for color i used with differnt
                        form like at some place i used numbers of the color and on some poins i mentioned color name directly.
